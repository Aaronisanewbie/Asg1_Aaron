# Project PopMart
This Project showcases the popular types of blind box that are being sold across Singapore. Blind Boxes have been a popular trend due to its nature to cause adrenaline rush that makes its user excited and a sense of fun while unboxing its content. Pop Mart has a wide range of collectibles characters to collect from. 

# Design Process
The general target customers would be teenagers and young adults as they would typically spend more. As a User, I wanted to be able to view how Popmart showcases their products by doing trailers and exclusive launches

# Features
When hyperlinks on top of the menu bar are hovered around, they will be underlined.
Allows you to see many different kinds of blind boxes
